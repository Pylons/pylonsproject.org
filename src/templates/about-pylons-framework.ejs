      <p>Pylons 1.0 is a lightweight web framework emphasizing flexibility and rapid development.</p>
      <p>Pylons combines the very best ideas from the worlds of Ruby, Python and Perl, providing a structured but extremely flexible Python web framework. It's also one of the first projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, which allows extensive re-use and flexibility — but only if you need it. Out of the box, Pylons aims to make web development fast, flexible and easy.</p>

        <h2 class="title text-blue">Maintenance-only mode</h2>
        <p>The Pylons web framework has merged with repoze.bfg into <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>, and is now in maintenance-only mode. You may submit a <a href="https://github.com/Pylons/pylons/pulls">pull request</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Pylons/pylons/issues">issue</a>, then respectfully request of the maintainers to accept it and make a release.</p>
        <p>It's highly recommended that new projects start with the new merged web framework, <a href="https://trypyramid.com/">Pyramid</a>.</p>
